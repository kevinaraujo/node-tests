## Node project to pratice TDD with JEST

I created this project in order to practice the funcionality of Jest, this powerful library based on Javascript to test the code.

This Project is using only javascript withou Typescript, since my goal is only to put on work my knowledge about Jest.

### Getting Started

Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies. Later, run `npm test` to run the tests.

### Carrinho folder

`Carrinho` folder has a subproject which has more tests detailed on it.

Run `npm install` into this folder to install the project dependencies. Later, run `npm test` to run the tests.
To get coverage report, please run `npm run test:coverage`.
